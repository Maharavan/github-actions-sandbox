# GitHub Actions Sandbox üöÄ

This is my personal repository to **practice and experiment with GitHub Actions**. üõ†Ô∏è

I use this repo to:  
- Learn how GitHub Actions workflows work üìö  
- Test CI/CD pipelines ‚öôÔ∏è  
- Experiment with triggers like push, pull_request, and schedule ‚è∞  
- Try out integrations with tools like Docker üê≥, AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Explore caching, matrix builds, and artifact management üóÉÔ∏è 
- Build custom actions using Docker, JavaScript, and composite actions üèóÔ∏è

## Getting Started üèÅ

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maharavan/github-actions-sandbox.git

3. Push changes and check the **Actions** tab to see the workflow run. ‚úÖ
